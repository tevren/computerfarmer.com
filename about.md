I farm computers at scale for a living. I'm a systems engineer and rubyist based out of NYC. I'm deeply interested in configuration management, release engineering, monitoring, and over-engineering all of the above. Over Engineering on purpose allows me to experiment and learn via application. I've started this site as a record of my adventures for future reference for myself and anyone else who may find it useful. 

Currently I work a lot with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/), and [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/). Previously I worked a lot with OS X and recorded my exploits at: [Columbia OS X Management](http://coxmanagement.wordpress.com/).

If you'd like to learn more about me, feel free to browse through my github profile and email me. The links are in the site footer.
