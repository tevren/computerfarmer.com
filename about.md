I have various hobbies. Most of them involve over-engineering simple tasks or learning new things through pratical applications. This site is where I'll document my adventures.

Typically I write my code in ruby, with the occasional perl here and there.

In my free time, I try to learn ruby, build useless projects and become a better overall Ops person.

If you'd like to learn more about me, feel free to browse through my github profile and email me. The links are in the site footer. 

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
